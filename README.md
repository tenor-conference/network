# TENOR Network

The TENOR Network brings together researchers and institutions around Technologies of Notation and Representation (TENOR). Its activities focus on the two principal modes of tracing ephemeral art practices in a more durable medium: Notations provide performers with a set of instructions or framings that guide their performance; Representations, in turn, preserve ephemeral art events (interpretations, improvisations or emergent collective performances) for comparison, analysis and archiving.
